## Work in progress

This is work in progress and at the very early stage of the development. For now most features here are more or less hardcoded. I am, however,
attempting to build some sort of strycture that I can easily modify as I go along.<p/>
At present you can set up the real world axis extremes using a method and the target of the graph is contained in a special method 
that will be called from onDraw.</p>
